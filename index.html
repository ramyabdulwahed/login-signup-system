  <h1>Writing Assignment 4: </h1>
    <p> My product: Flickr In 2004, because of digital photography complexity development, Flickr was introduced as a digital photography platform which
    integrated components such as digital cameras; photo management software, phone-camera, photo printing and emailing services that had been constructed 
    individually and connected them in a massive open database. The two objectives behind the development of Flickr included first, that they wanted to 
    enable people to have control over their image privacy and image organization. Second, it provided users with access to multiple creative features 
    such as tagging, photo sets, groups, and maps to assist users in photo organization. The main reason behind Flickr favorable outcome was it because it 
    was able to recognize that the existing photo management tools are outdated and limited, especially for users who have vast collections of digital 
    photos. As a result, Flickr introduced features like tagging, photo sets, groups, and maps to provide innovative ways of organizing photos. 
    In 2007, Yahoo decided to shift all Yahoo picture accounts to Flickr, this demonstrates that it was preferred over alternative photo management
    software because it was a more powerful and user-friendly software. </p>
