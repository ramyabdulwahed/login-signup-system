  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
<p> The Software development process is a cycle where requirements are gathered, analyzed and planned to develop a software. It consists of multiple stages 
  that include gathering & understanding requirements, designing & implementing, and testing & maintaining. Next, designing and implementing is where 
  the software requirements are analyzed and then fulfilled by using a programming language to build the software. Precisely fulfilling the design 
  requirements, ends up with quality software. The last stage is where the software is tested, to get rid of leftover errors by developing strong test 
  cases for each requirement by considering the input, output, parameters and constraints. Software development is important since today everything is 
  dependent on software, computers or some type of electronics. It’s essential for the market, since it helps improve efficiency, satisfy customer demands,
  create web robots for online sites and reduce complexity. Moreover, the development of new products, which is essential for the economic world, relies on
  Software development. Being able to program is not sufficient to get a good job these days, one must know the entire software design process which is why
  software development process is important. I think discord is a well-designed software since it has a user-friendly interface which makes it easy for 
  anyone to use it. It supports both text and audio, it allows users to create their own servers in which they can introduce bots, which can be assigned 
  tasks and improve server organization. So, discord enables users to build environments where people in a server can interact with others on channels 
  whether by text/voice. Users can direct messages and share screens with each other, thus it's a useful platform for individuals who participate in virtual
  meetings. Users can download and access discord from multiple devices at the same time, since various operating systems like Linux, windows, android, and
  macOS, support Discord. There are   few software's that offer this feature today.</p>

  <p> The majority of the client-designer interactions take place at the requirements stage to ensure that all the client's demands are met and understood 
  to make other stages more efficient and to lessen any misunderstandings or disagreements throughout the developing process. During the requirement 
  gathering stage, requirements such as functionality, user requirements, system requirements, constraints, and other properties of the desired software 
  are gathered, analyzed and documented to satisfy all the client expectations. The two key questions the designer will think about to come up with good 
  list of requirements are: who will be using the product and what problem are we trying to solve. Gathering firm requirements is important because it 
  gives the teams in charge of building and testing the software a shared in depth understanding and vision of the software goals and customer expectations. 
  Therefore, framing the entire project requirements, reduces the probability of bad outcomes like project failure or software bug. Thus, the stage is 
  important for the entire software development process because a successful software product requires a gathered list of well-defined specifications.

    <h1>5 user stories for Discord: </h1> 
  <p> As a discord user, I want to be able to see my tagged favorite friends on the very top of my friend list in alphabetical order, so that so that 
    I can easily direct message any of them. 
  As a discord user, I want to be able to put my account on private mode, so that I don’t receive any direct messages from random people.  
  As a discord user, I want to be able to mute and deafen myself from the main page, so that I don’t have to go to the audio settings to manage it. 
  As a discord user, I want to be able to view the software on any operating system store including windows, iOS, macOS so that I can download the software
    easily on any device without using any third-party apps. 
  As a discord user, I want to be able to automate an AI bot in my private server that would perform assigned tasks consistently, so that it I don't have to
    perform everything manually. </p>

     <h1>Writing Assignment 3: </h1> 
    
      <p>The three elements of empathy are emotions, culture and context. Emotion emphasizes that the comprehension of customers and the physiological component
      of their experience should be the same as the comprehension of our selves. Next, culture is understanding how civilization influences the behavior and 
      selection of customers. Lastly, Context is the consideration of personal connections of consumers such as environment and social interactions as they 
      use goods and services. The three old business models are the sheep, homo economicus and ‘task and goals’ model. The sheep model strategy was to 
      attract clients using marketing messages where customers were viewed as impressionable individuals that shift opinions according to marketing messaging.
      Thus, customer demands were created and managed by organizations. The problem with that model is it neglects customers emotions, context and culture by 
      excluding the variables that influence customer decisions. Moving onto homo economicus model, it focuses on qualities/ features of goods and services 
      rather on marketing messages. In a sense, it prioritizes quantity over quality, and it implies that customers are attracted by self-interest and utility.
      Also, it lacks empathy because it ignores the emotional aspects of decision-making, and the influence of culture and context on choices. 
      It prevents organizations from focusing on the experience offered rather than what motivates the customers to buy.The task and goal model objective was 
      to satisfy customer needs by optimizing usability and efficiency of goods and services.  Meaning that the objective was not to end up with an outstanding
      product or service, instead adequate. To summarize, the problem with all the old business models is that they lacked a considerate emphasis on people and
      how they use goods and services. Moreover, they deal with the social world and ambiguity of markets by reducing complexity which oversimplifies customers
      ' lives, which isn’t a long-term strategy. </p>
